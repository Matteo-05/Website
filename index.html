                <h3> Plagiarism </h3>
                <p>
                    Plagiarism is considered improper use of content that is protected by copyright.
                    Any work that you refernce in your papers or other mediums of content need to attribute the
                    author's whose work you used. If this is not done the author/ owner of the content you used
                    can either take your work or recieve any profits you have from publishing it.

                <h3> Citations </h3>
                <p>
                    Citations are a way for you to tell anyone viewing your work that you have 
                    recieved the information from someone else's work/research. To properly cite something
                    you also need to provide a way for the viewer to see the orginal work that gathered information from.

                <h3> Copyright </h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                    Copyright protects authors' works and makes it so in order for others
                    to use these works they need to either purchase a license from the company or owner or alternatively
                    you can mention where you reference your source by citing in in-text and also citing it at the end of your 
                    piece of writing/ content. There are many types of things defended by copyright most of which are listed 
                    on the main body of text in this website. For those wondering how long copyright lasts, well it is 70 years after
                    the author's death. After this duration of time the work becomes public and anyone can use it without having to cite it.
                    There are also some different rules for different piece of work so I would suggest reading <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/index.html" style="color: white;">this website for more info.</a>

                <h2> What is Copyright? </h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;"> Copyright &copy is a law that protects the intelectual property of an author.
                    It is a way for people to claim authorship of their work which can be: literary works,
                    dramatic works, photographs, grpahics, computer programs, architectural designs and any other
                    medium.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2> What does copyright protect? </h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">
                    You can copyright any piece of original work that you publish. Everything that
                    is considered original can be copyrighted under most circumstances. A short list 
                    of examples includes: 
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul style="margin-left: 3%;">
                    <li>Musical pieces</li>
                    <li>Photographs</li>
                    <li>Illustrations</li>
                    <li>Research</li>
                    <li>Literary works</li>
                    <li>Computer programs</li>
                    <li>Architectural designs</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Something that you should note is that copyright doesn't protect:
                    processes, concepts, principles or discoveries. These can be publically used without the 
                    need for a license and noone has copyright over these subjects.

                <h2> What is plagiarism? </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the people in this website might be students and have heard the term <em>plagiarism</em>
                    quite frequently. Plagiarism refers to using other people's work and calling it your own be it for
                    personal profit or a simple school assignment. It can be intentional or unintentional but it is wrong 
                    regardless. In order to make sure we aren't at risk at misusing other's work we need to undestand
                    hot to <em> cite </em> works that we use. There are different types of citations but the genral rule is that 
                    you need to incldue a date of the paper that you are referncing, a link and of course the name of the author.
                    There is much more that goes into citing works but these are the basics of what to include in a citation.
                    <br><br>
                    Other than simply citing another person's work you also need to make sure you cite where in your paper
                    you used the information. These are called in-text citation and they are more simple to do than regular citations.
                    However you must cite the work at the end of your paper so anyone readin gyour work has a reference of where to go to
                    for more details on the information that you pulled form the website/book/research paper.
                </p>

                <h2> How can we use some else's work? </h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on the type of work that we are using and the medium we are using it in there are 
                    different rules we must obide by. There are two main examples I'm sure everyone can easily visualize.
                    First is a citation in your school work and second is a license to use content in a YouTube video.
                    Citations are mostly used in research papers and written assignments and licenses are used for 
                    content like videos or music. There is also a new kind of ownership license over digital art called NFT
                    but that isn't too important to the topic at hand. NFTs are just tokens of ownerships over digital art products.
                    For a more in-depth guide as to how to use citations you can view the citation webpage.
