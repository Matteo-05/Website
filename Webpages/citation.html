            <h2 id="link1">What are citations</h2>
            <p>
                Citations are the way we credit the work of other people that we referenced
                to create our own piece. You can cite the material that you used in-text which
                is not always required or alternatively you can cite the work at the end of your
                material. There are some main point that always need to be included to have a full citation
                regardless of the type of citation we are using:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Name of the original author</li>
                <li>Title of the work</li>
                <li>Company that publsihed or sponsored that work</li>
                <li>Date it was published</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>

            <h2 id="link2">Why do we cite things</h2>
            <p>
                We cite sources to avoid plagiarism, to credit other people's work and reference their findings.
                Other than avoiding plagiarism and credit authors we also citation to help people who are looking to find relevant 
                information to the topic they are reading about. Other people can get a better idea of what your
                work aims to do if they know what sources you drew from. Next, we also use citations to differentiate our own thoughts
                from that of the author of the work we are referencing. This makes the reader able to differenciate 
                the different ideas presented. Lastly we use citations to support our work through evidence. 
                The amount of citations you have often shows how much research you have done and makes your work more credible.
                <br><br>
                We need to cite things such as quotes, paraphrased sayings, when we use eisting ideas and when we want to reference 
                another person's work. There are more times that we need to cite the information you use but these are the most common.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2 id="link3">How can we cite works</h2>
            <p>
                There are many different ways to cite works and how you should cite something depends on the specific case that
                you find yourself in. If you are only citing a material for a minor point you can consider mentioning the author
                or using a small in-text citation or you can use footnotes.
                Other than deciding how to cite you should also consider the type of citations you are going to be using in your paper.
                There are differnet types of citations that we use and they may differ depending on the type of work you are doing.
                It is important to decide how you are citing to shorten the time you have to spend on citations and also give a sense of
                continuity.
